      You are a senior recruiter at a top global company. You've received a job application with the following information:

      Position Applied: ${positionApplied}
      Experience: ${experience}
      Education: ${education}
      Skills: ${skills}

      Based on this, your task is to:

      Analyze if this candidate is a career switcher (by checking if their experience and education are not directly related to the applied position).

      Generate 5-10 thoughtful and realistic interview questions that you, as an experienced recruiter, would ask the candidate in a first-round interview. The questions should reflect your understanding of their background and the role they are applying for.

      Assume you are speaking naturally in a conversational tone (avoid robotic or overly formal wording).

      Do not explicitly ask if they are a career switcher â€” use your judgment and ask questions accordingly.

      Keep each question concise and suitable to be read aloud in a voice interview format (max 20 seconds per question).

      Output your questions as a single string in plain text. Start each question with a dash (-) and keep the format consistent. Don't include any explanations, just the questions.

      Example output format:

      Tell me about a project where you had to learn something new quickly.

      In your previous experience, how did you handle situations where you had to lead without formal authority?

        error: "Failed to generate questions",
      },
      {
        status: 500,

    );
  }
